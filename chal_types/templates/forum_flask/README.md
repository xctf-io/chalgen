# Flask Basic Forum
This is a minimal forum written in python with Flask. It supports only the bare minumum of features to allow discussions, including user accounts, threads, and comments.
To install, run the following commands:
source venv/bin/activate
./run.sh

On first run, the default subforums will be created. Although custom subforums are not supported through any user interface, it is possible to modify forum/setup.py to create custom subforums.
